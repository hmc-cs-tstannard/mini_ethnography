            <p class="text-faded mb-4">	I’ve started noticing that I seem to always pick the bathroom stall that doesn’t have toilet paper.
               After I actively thought about this the first time, I started to consciously think about what factors I was thinking about when 
               I went into a stall. I also thought about what factors would make me switch stalls after I had opened a door. 
               Are my standards for stalls higher or lower than others? 
               This topic as puzzled me for a long time and I would like to know more information about how people choose which bathroom stall to use.

This is to maintain a consistency in answers because different restrooms have vastly different layouts. People have different habits depending on how many stalls are available. In order to compare similar opinions, I am talking to people who generally use same bathrooms.

        <h2 class="mb-4">Interviews</h2>
        <div> </div>
              <p class="text-faded mb-4">	
         For my first interview, I talked to 5 people (3 girls and 2 guys joined in). Three of them agreed they preferred the handicapped stall. One was more specific and said they preferred the use the second stall on the right. Four said they prefer a stall on the edge and furthest from the door to avoid people walking past your stall. When posed with the question: The stall that you had your heart set on using has a piece of toilet paper (used as a tissue) in the toilet bowl. Only 2 people said they would stay and use that stall. One said he would flush and then use the stall. The other two said they would find a new stall. 
        </p>

        <p class="text-faded mb-4">	
         In another conversation with some friends (3 girls) I learned more about their habits. This group was divided, yet opinionated about which bathroom stall they used.  We first talked about the handicapped stall. Again, there were mixed opinions on the stall but they all brought up valid points. One girl stated that despite the luxury of the handicapped stall she feels it would be immoral, especially if someone who needed that stall came in. Others commented that although that is a legitimate fear that they do have, they reason they could finish quick enough to not cause too much inconvenience. There were many discussed advantages to the handicapped stall. First, it usually sits at the opposite side of the restroom so there very few people walking past you. Secondly, it’s very spacious which is nice if you have a back pack with you. Finally, there was a group consensus that the handicapped stall is reliably clean which is not something you can guarantee about any other stall. Without asking one girl in particular mentioned that the toilet paper scenario asked to the first group I talked to. She said there were very few scenarios in which she would leave or even flush the toilet before using the stall she had her heart set on. 
Finally, as hypothesized, each girl agreed that although it’s difficult for them to articulate exactly how they choose which stall to use, they are deliberate in trying to pick the most unused stall in the restroom.
        </p>

        <p class="text-faded mb-4">	
         Another day at lunch, I brought the topic up again with a group of six people – both male and female. The males had some good insight that they shared. They thought about their pick of stall like an equation that took in parameters such as emergency status (which would prioritize closer stalls) and the mod (base 2) of stalls (used to optimized likelihood of using a stall adjacent to someone else).
